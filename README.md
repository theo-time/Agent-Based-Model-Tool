# Agent-Based-Model-Tool
This project aim to build an Agent Based Modelling tool in Javascript which could be used to simulate many complex phenomenon. The purpose is also to introduce genetic algorithm and machine learning features, so that Agents can be trained to optimize their behavior. Agent's DNA could then be saved and shared among users of the projects.
